---Slide 1---

Hi everyone, and warm welcome to today’s webinar. (pause)
Thank you for taking the time to join us. (pause)
I promise this webinar will give you a lot of clarity
and actionable takeaways. (pause)

Before we dive in, I want you to do one thing with me. (pause)
Just take a deep breath… inhale… and slowly exhale. (inhale, exhale)

Perfect (smile). (pause)

Why am I asking you to do this? (pause)

---Slide 2---

Because this next one hour is about you —
your career, your growth, and your breakthrough(pause)

— no matter where you are joining from,
you and I are here
because you are looking for something more 
in your career. (pause)
Right? (pause)

---Slide 3---

Alright, before we dive deeper,
let me give you a quick intro about myself. (pause)
My name is Rajinder Kumar, I’m a Certified Career Coach,
and I’ve been in the IT industry for over 20 years. (pause)

I’ve worked with hundreds of professionals —
helping them land better jobs, negotiate higher salaries,
and build careers that actually excite them. (pause)

But let me be very clear — today is not about me. (pause)
(speak louder) This is about you. (pause)

Because I know many of you are feeling this right now —
you’ve been sending out applications, resumes, LinkedIn requests…
and it feels like they’re just disappearing into a black hole. (pause)

(pause, nod, look at camera)
And that’s (speak louder) exactly why you’re here today. (pause)
Because I’m going to show you why this happens…
and more importantly, how to break out of that cycle. (pause)

---Slide 4---

Now before we go further,
let’s set a few simple rules,
so you can get the most, out of this session. (pause)

Rule number one — be fully present. (pause)
This is your time. (pause)
If you’re scrolling on your phone or checking emails,
you might miss, some really valuable stuff
that could help your career.(pause)

Rule number two — engage with me. [pause]
This isn’t a boring lecture. [pause]
I’ll be asking questions, running quick polls…
and the more you participate,
the more clarity you’ll gain.

Rule number three — keep an open mind. (pause)
Some of the facts I’m about to share
may feel uncomfortable. (pause)
But trust me, these are real facts —
and they can lead to your breakthrough. Yah!

Alright!

So, are we ready to go? [pause]
Click on the 👍 thumbs-up icon if you’re ready. (pause)

---Slide 5---

Perfect, so who is this webinar really for? (pause)

This is for you if you’re searching for a job
but not getting results.
Maybe you’ve been laid off,
or you’re trying to make a career transition,
Or maybe you took a career break, and now you want to return.(pause)

It’s also for you if you’re a fresher, or maybe mid-level,
or even a senior professional —
IT or non-IT, it doesn’t matter. (pause)

Basically — if you want to move forward but don’t know how…
then you’re in (speak louder) exactly the right place. (pause)

---Slide 6---

Alright, let’s make this interactive. [pause, smile]
I want you to participate in a quick poll —
how many years of experience do you have?

A poll should be flashing on your screen.
Please go ahead and select your option. [pause]

👉 Options: Fresher, up to 4 years, 5–10 years, and 10+ years. [pause]

[smile] Perfect. [pause]
I see we’ve got a great mix here…

A few freshers just starting their journey. [pause]

Quite a good number with up to 4 years of experience. [pause]

Many of you in that 5–10 years range. yah [pause]

And equally strong participation from those with 10+ years. [pause, nod]

That’s wonderful
because what I’ll share today
applies to all of you, yah
no matter which stage you’re at

---Slide 7---

Now let’s address the big question —
why are so many professionals
stuck in this never-ending job search loop? (pause)

Is it because you don’t have talent? (pause)
No. (pause)

Is it because you’re not putting in effort? (pause)
Definitely not — you’re applying, you’re trying. (pause)

(speak louder) The truth is… it’s the strategy. (pause)
Most people are applying, but in the wrong way. (pause)

It’s what I call the ‘blind application method’ —
applying without direction,
without a proper plan,
and just hoping something will click. (pause) Yah!

And that’s (speak louder) exactly
what we’re going to break today. (pause)

---Slide 8---

And Here’s something surprising —
studies show that 85% of professionals
are struggling in their job search. (pause)

And it’s not because they’re not capable. (pause)
It’s not because they’re lazy. (pause)

It’s because they don’t have the right guidance. (pause)

So the real problem isn’t your skills —
it’s the way the job search system is set up. (pause)

---Slide 9---

According to Human Resources Director’s data, check this out:
👉 44% of job seekers have a gap in their work experience.
👉 42% say their hard and soft skills are weakening.
👉 And 40% admit they’re struggling with (soft tone) confidence. (pause)

Now, when you combine these struggles with the old ‘apply’ method —
just sending resumes online and waiting —
it’s no wonder so many professionals feel stuck. (pause)

And I’ll show you (speak louder)
exactly why this approach doesn’t work anymore. (pause)

---Slide 10---

Alright, before we go any deeper, let’s pause for a second. (pause)

I want to quickly show you how the traditional job search framework actually works. (pause)

---Slide 11---

Because what most of us have been told since day one:
‘If you want a job, just go online, find openings, and apply.’ (pause)

So what do we do? (pause)
We go to LinkedIn, Indeed, or any other portal… (pause)
We polish up the resume… (pause)
Click apply… and then wait, right? (pause)

We imagine the process will look like this:
First, an HR call. (pause)
Then maybe a technical round. (pause)
And then — if everything goes well — an offer letter. (pause)

But let’s be honest… does it really happen that way? (pause)
Let me ask you — how many of you have applied to 20, 30, maybe even 50 jobs… (pause)
In a week… and then silence? (pause)
No reply, no HR call. (pause)

---Slide 12---

Now, let’s take a moment and see — where is your job search actually going? (pause)

---Slide 13---

Here’s what happens:
You search for jobs, update your resume, apply… then nothing. (pause)
Silence. (pause)

Then again — search, apply, wait… rejected. (pause)
And then repeat. (pause)

So basically, what we’re doing is:
Apply → Wait → Rejected → Repeat. (pause)

And that’s how so many professionals get stuck in this never-ending job search loop. (pause)

But the big question is — why? (pause)

---Slide 14---

The answer is simple — job portals are overloaded. (pause)

Every job you see online gets 400, 500… sometimes even 1000 applicants. (pause)

Let me show you a real example. (pause)
This is an actual screenshot I took from LinkedIn. (pause)
In just one single day, 469 people applied for one job. (pause)

Now, what does this mean? (pause)
It means the competition is unbelievably steep. (pause)

And if you’re also applying for that same job, guess what? (pause)
Your resume just becomes application number 470 in that long queue. (pause)
(speak louder) That’s the reality. (pause)

---Slide 15---

Alright, let’s take a closer look at how this process really works. (pause)

Let’s say 250 people apply for a single job opening. (pause)
And honestly, 250 is on the lower side — usually, it’s double or even triple that. (pause)

Now here’s the problem: recruiters don’t have time to go through every single resume. (pause)

So what happens? (pause)
They rely on technology — Applicant Tracking Systems, or ATS. (pause)
These systems scan your resume before it even reaches a human being. (pause)

And here’s the shocking part — 75% of resumes are rejected automatically. (pause)
Just gone. (pause)
Nobody ever reads them. (pause)

And for the resumes that do make it through? (pause)
Recruiters spend only 6–8 seconds scanning them. (pause)

From there, maybe 10–12 people get HR screening calls. (pause)
Then only 4–5 reach the next rounds. (pause)
And finally — only one person gets the job offer. (pause)

So the funnel keeps shrinking at every step. (pause)
That’s the harsh reality of the market today. (pause)

---Slide 16---

And here’s something most professionals don’t realize… (pause)

There are more than 150 different ATS systems in the market today. (pause)
Each one has its own rules, its own algorithms, its own way of filtering candidates. (pause)

And guess what — more than 90% of companies are already using some kind of ATS. (pause)
About 70% of large organizations use them. (pause)
Even 20% of mid and small companies. (pause)

So no matter where you apply — LinkedIn, Indeed, or company websites — chances are, the very first person reviewing your resume isn’t a person at all… (pause)
It’s a robot. (pause)

---Slide 17---

And see — no matter where you apply, the process is the same. (pause)

Your resume goes into these funnels… filtered, screened, and reduced at every step. (pause)

That’s why it often feels like your applications are just disappearing into a black hole. (pause)
Because in reality… most of them are. (pause)

---Slide 18---

So here’s the truth — if you’re doing (speak louder)
exactly what everyone else is doing,
you’re invisible. (pause)
-------------------------------
And that’s why so many professionals feel stuck. (pause)
Not because you’re not talented or capable (pause)
----------------------------------
But because the system is designed to filter you out. (pause)
-----------------------------------
Now let me ask you — would you really want to struggle
just to be part of a success rate that’s less than 1%? (pause)
-----------------------------------
Right… it’s tough, my friend. (pause)
(soft tone) Really tough. (pause)
------------------------------------
But (speak louder) here’s the good news —
once you learn how to play differently,
the whole game changes. (pause)
------------------------------------
---Slide 19---

Now, let’s talk about the real
cost you’re paying. (pause)
--------------------------------------
If you’re spending 60 to 90 days applying for 150,
maybe even 200 jobs online… (pause)
And the success rate is less than 2% —
sometimes even below 1% —
what does that really mean? (pause)
----------------------------------------------

---Slide 20---

It means you’re not getting HR calls. (pause)
You’re not getting interview offers. (pause)

Instead, you’re losing time… (pause)
You’re losing potential salary… (pause)
You’re creating gaps in your career… (pause)
And most importantly —
you’re losing your (soft tone) confidence. (pause)

And let me tell you — (soft tone)
confidence is the foundation of everything. (pause)
When that goes down,
everything else becomes harder. (pause)

---Slide 21---
Alright, another poll time.

Select, what’s your biggest challenge?

👉 You’re applying for hundreds of jobs
but hearing nothing back. (pause)
👉 You’re not sure which direction
your career should really take. (pause)
👉 And deep down, you feel like your skills
aren’t being showcased the way they deserve. (pause)

alright - “I can see many of you selected
‘no response from applications.’
That’s such a common struggle right now.”

“some are also saying
they are unsure about the right career direction —
I’ll be covering that too.”

“And quite a few feel their skills
aren’t being showcased.

don’t worry — (soft tone) 
This is the exact struggle most professionals
are going through right now. (pause)

---Slide 22---

Here’s where most people go wrong. (pause)

They use what I call the scattergun approach. (pause)
Apply to every job they can find online…
without a clear direction,
without a placement plan,
without a strategy. (pause)

Just hoping that something clicks. (pause)
And hope, unfortunately, is not a strategy. (pause)

---Slide 23---

And because of this… here’s what usually happens: (pause)

Around 70% of job seekers end up changing their goals. (pause)
They settle for any role they can find —
not because they want to,
but because financial pressure
and loss of (soft tone) confidence force them to. (pause)

But let me tell you something important —
you don’t need to downgrade your dreams. (pause)
What you really need is to change your strategy. (pause)

---Slide 24---

Now, let’s talk about something very important —
the hidden job market. (pause)

Most people don’t know… around 70% of jobs
are never even advertised online. (pause)
That’s right — 7 out of 10 jobs
are not posted on portals. (pause)

Think about it… do companies always put up a job ad? (pause)
No. (pause)

Many roles are filled through referrals,
internal hiring, or networking. (pause)
By the time a job is posted publicly, 
the decision is often already half made. (pause)

So let me ask you — if there are two candidates:
👉 One applies online, like everyone else. (pause)
👉 Another connects directly with the recruiter,
or comes through a referral. (pause)

Who do you think has the advantage? (pause)
(pause, nod, smile)
(speak louder) Exactly — referral or direct connect. (pause)
And that’s where the shift has to happen. (pause)

But here’s the challenge —
as per "Select Software Reviews"
nearly 30% of professionals say
they actually struggle with networking. (pause)

So it’s not just about knowing what to do —
you need a clear plan
to actually reach into this hidden job market. (pause)
And that’s (speak louder)
exactly what I’m going to walk you through now. (pause)

---Slide 25---

Alright, let me break this down step by step —
so you know (speak louder)
exactly how to build your networking strategy. (pause)

Step 1: Identify and create a list of 50 Growing Companies. (pause)
How do you do that? (pause)
Simple — go to Google and type:

‘Give me a list of 10 large, fast-growing IT companies
in Canada based on Crunchbase’s most recent financial year data,
along with their LinkedIn URLs. (pause)

what is Crunchbase- 
Crunchbase is a platform
and database that provides
detailed business information
and intelligence on millions of public
and private companies globally.

let's back to the topic.
We already, typed in the search box
Now, Click on "AI Mode" button… not search button, yah! and here we go. (pause)
It’s going to do all the analysis for you...
and your list is ready in seconds..
and here it is (pause)

repeat this a few times and you’ll have at least 50. (pause)
Put them in an Excel sheet. (pause)

Step 2: Find the Potential Employees. (pause)
Look for people working in those companies —
ideally decision makers or people in your target roles. (pause)

Now here’s the big question:
how do you actually connect with them? (pause)
The answer is — you need an icebreaker. (pause)

That could be:
👉 An alumni connection from your college or university. (pause)
👉 A former colleague from your previous organization.
👉 A common LinkedIn contact Or even a shared professional interest. (pause)

Alright, let me pick OpenText company as an example.

and Head to LinkedIn… open the company page… and here we go.
Then click on the “People” tab. yah! right here..

Now, let’s find an alumni working there.
for this example, I am considering Conestoga (kones-toga) College

So, First, select your college to filter.
Next, choose your country, I am selecting Canada. yah!
Now, in the search box, type “Human Resources” let me type and hit enter.

So far, we’ve selected college, country, and department.
Now let’s see — is there anyone working in recruitment?
Yes! Select that filter… and your list is ready.

My dear friend, this is exactly
how you need to build connections and get referrals.

Now, let’s say we pick 50 companies,
and from each company,
we connect with 3 people, just 3.
That’s already 150 new leads.

Step 3: Connect and Build Relationships. (pause)
Now, this is where most job seekers go wrong. (pause)
They send a connection request and immediately say:
“Please help me with a job.” (pause)
That doesn’t work. (pause)
instead, we need to write - 
“Hi [Name], as we studied together at [University],
I’d love to add you to my professional network.” (pause)

build a bond first. (pause)
Engage with their posts. (pause)
Share something useful. (pause)
Start a meaningful conversation. (pause)
And slowly, you open the door to career opportunities. (pause)

Now imagine this — you’ve created a list of 150 potential leads. (pause)
Do you need all 150 to respond? (pause)
No. (pause)

Even if just 5% respond — that’s 7 or 8 people. (pause)
And trust me, one right connection
is enough to completely change your career trajectory. (pause)

That’s the power of networking the right way. (pause)

---Slide 26---

DEMO — keep it blank.

---Slide 27---

Alright, now let’s shift gears and talk about resumes. (pause)

Take a look at this — this is an actual resume heat map. (pause)
It’s based on eye-tracking research — showing (speak louder)
exactly how recruiters scan a resume. (pause)

Here’s what it tells us:
👉 Recruiters don’t read your resume line by line. (pause)
👉 They skim it. (pause)
👉 And the top one-third of your resume? (pause)
That’s your prime real estate. (pause)

But here’s the problem —
most job seekers use their resume like a job description. (pause)
They fill it with duties and responsibilities
instead of highlighting achievements, impact, and skills. (pause)

Here’s the shocking fact —
According to Human Resources Director’s data
88% of employers believe they miss out on qualified candidates
because resumes are not optimized for ATS. (pause)

So even if you’re talented, even if you’ve done amazing work —
if your resume isn’t structured the right way,
the system filters you out before a human even sees it. (pause)

That’s why I always say — your resume is not just a piece of paper,
it’s your sales document. (pause)
It needs to sell your skills, not just list your duties. (pause)

---Slide 28---

Alright, Now it's poll time--

Question: “Which part of your job search
do you find the hardest to crack?”

👉 Struggling with your resume or LinkedIn profile
👉 Struggling with the job search process
👉 Not knowing how to build meaningful connections
and get referrals

Go ahead, and select the right option

(pause, look at chat, nod)

Ah! I see many of you said the job search process itself feels the hardest —
that’s very common.”

“Quite a few of you also mentioned struggling with resumes and LinkedIn — again,
that’s a huge part of the journey.”

“And yes, some of you pointed to networking and referrals —
which, by the way, is often the hidden key to faster results.

See, once you identify your biggest block,
we can work on breaking it. (pause)

And that’s what the Job Success System is all about. (pause)

---Slide 29---

Alright… now let me share the solution to all these challenges. (pause)

and that is Job Success System. (pause)

The beauty of this system is… it doesn’t matter which industry you’re in. (pause)
It doesn’t matter whether you’re a fresher, a mid-level professional, or even a senior leader. (pause)

This works — because it’s not theory. (pause)
It’s a step-by-step system
that has already helped hundreds of professionals
land jobs faster, with better salaries,
and with more (soft tone) confidence. (pause)

And now, I’m going to walk you through (speak louder)
exactly how this system works. (pause)

---Slide 30---

This system is built on six strong pillars —
and each one is designed
to take you step by step from where you are now…
to where you want to be. (pause)

First pillar — Skill Assessment. (pause)
We don’t guess. (pause)
We use tools, real job descriptions,
and data to see where you stand today. (pause)
What’s strong, what needs work. (pause)
Because once you know that clearly,
you stop wasting time in the wrong direction. (pause)

Second pillar — Customized Placement Plan. (pause)
This is your roadmap. (pause)
On day one itself, you’ll know — 
who you are, what’s missing,
and (speak louder)
exactly what steps you need to take next.
Every task is broken into clear action items. (pause)
No confusion, no guesswork. (pause)

Third pillar — Resume Writing. (pause)
Your resume isn’t just a piece of paper,
it’s your sales pitch. (pause)
Even if you have the right skills,
if your resume doesn’t sell them —
you’ll get filtered out. (pause)
We’ll show you how to create a resume
and cover letter that not only passes ATS,
but also impresses decision-makers. (pause)

Fourth pillar — Personal Branding. (pause)
and the truth — if you’re not visible, you’re invisible. (pause)
Employers, recruiters, and even hiring managers
look at LinkedIn before making decisions. (pause)
We’ll help you build your brand
and tell your personal story,
so opportunities start coming to you. (pause)

Fifth pillar — Interview Preparation. (pause)
Because you don’t get hired for your resume. (pause)
You get hired for how you show up in the interview room. (pause)
We’ll work on your storytelling,
your (soft tone) confidence, and your strategies —
so you can walk in, answer with clarity,
and walk out with an offer. (pause)

Sixth pillar — Hidden Job Market. (pause)
This is where the real magic happens. (pause)
Around 70% of jobs are never even advertised —
they’re filled through referrals and connections. (pause)
We’ll show you how to reach those opportunities
and stand out where most people don’t even look. (pause)

And that’s why I call this a one-stop system.
It covers everything you need,
so you’re never stuck on what to do next.”

Now let’s talk about
what you actually gain from this system. (pause)

With this system, you’re not just sending out better resumes —
you’re securing more interview calls,
more job offers, and most importantly,
you’re finally getting a clear direction for your career. (pause)

And the return on investment? (pause)
It’s big. (pause)

👉 First, salary gains — because once you position yourself right,
you can actually negotiate better. (pause)
👉 Second, time savings — no more wasting 3 to 6 months applying
blindly with no results. (pause)
👉 Third, a clear vision of your career path — you’ll know (speak louder)
exactly where you’re going and how to get there. (pause)
👉 And above all — you’ll get back your (soft tone) confidence. (pause)

And trust me, (soft tone) confidence changes everything. (pause)

Because when you’re confident,
you don’t just apply for jobs… (pause)
You go out there, you network, you connect,
and opportunities start coming to you. (pause)

---Slide 37---

Alright, so now let me walk you through
what we’re actually going to cover in this 4-day workshop. (pause)

These are live sessions — every Friday and Saturday,
9 AM to 10:30 AM EST. (pause)
That’s 90 minutes of focused training each time. (pause)

👉 Day 1 – Skill Assessment & Placement Plan
We’ll start with a deep skill assessment
using real job descriptions and our exclusive tool. (pause)
By the end of session,
you’ll have a personalized placement plan
that clearly defines your value, your gaps,
and your action steps. (pause)
Basically — who you are, what’s missing,
and how to fix it. (pause)

👉 Day 2 – Resume & Cover Letter Mastery
We’ll cover everything about resumes
that actually get interviews. (pause)
We’ll go through the Resume Heat Map,
Top 5 Resume Mistakes,

and even scoring your resume with ATS tools. (pause)
And yes — we’ll create custom cover letters too. (pause)

👉 Day 3 – LinkedIn & Networking Mastery
The third week is about making LinkedIn
and networking work for you. (pause)
From profile optimization to building your personal brand,
telling your story,
and connecting with decision-makers —

👉 Day 4 – Job Search & Hidden Opportunities
And in the final week,
we’ll go deep into job search strategies beyond portals. (pause)
I’ll show you (speak louder)
exactly how to tap into the hidden job market,
how to get referrals,
and I’ll even give you ready-to-use message templates
you can send to recruiters and professionals today. (pause)

By the end of this,
you won’t just have a resume or a LinkedIn profile —
you’ll have a complete system to land interviews, get referrals,
and secure the right offers. (pause)

---Slide 38---

Now, I know I’ve already shared a lot with you today… (pause)
But let me be very honest —
what I’ve shared so far is just the tip of the iceberg. (pause)

Inside the Job Success System,
we don’t just talk about concepts… (pause)
We go step by step, hands-on, with the right tools,
templates, and guidance. (pause)
That’s how real results happen. (pause)

And to show you this isn’t theory… (pause)
Let me share a couple of quick stories of people
who actually applied this exact system —
and completely transformed their careers. (pause)

---Slide 39---

Let me share a couple of quick stories. (pause)

Rishabh — RISHABH LANDED MULTIPLE OFFERS IN A MONTH! (pause)
He had great (smile) skills, but no interviews. (pause)
Then we teamed up and worked together on his resume,
his LinkedIn, and his strategy. (pause)

Within weeks, he had multiple interview calls. (pause)
He ended up with two offers in the same week. (pause)

---Slide 40---

Siddhant — GOT A MASSIVE SALARY HIKE! (pause)
But he was stuck in his role for years,
frustrated and not moving forward. (pause)

We applied the system, he connected directly with decision-makers,
and in just two months he doubled his salary. (pause)

---Slide 41---

Now, let’s talk about the value of everything you’ll get in this workshop. (pause)

And I’m not just saying this — if you check online,
here’s what people actually charge for the same services: (pause)
👉 Skill Assessment & Placement Plan: Around $250 if you look online. (pause)
👉 Resume Writing Services: The bare minimum is $279 — and that’s just for a one-time resume. (pause)
👉 LinkedIn & Networking Mastery: Around $349. (pause)
👉 Job Search & Hidden Opportunities Strategies: Around $150. (pause)

---Slide 42---

Altogether, that’s $1,028 worth of value — and this is value, not price. (pause)

But that’s not what you’ll pay. (pause)
I understand your situation and want to make this as accessible as possible. (pause)

The value of this workshop is $1,028, but that is not the price — not even half. (pause)
The regular price on our website is $349. (pause)
But since you’re serious and have already spent time with me today, even that is not the price for you. (pause)

The special webinar price is just $249. (pause)

If you decide today, that’s all you pay — and you’ll get the entire 4-week live workshop, including all tools, templates, and personalized guidance. (pause)

---Slide 43---

Now, I don’t want you to just take my word for it. (pause)

We’ve already helped hundreds of professionals — people just like you — land their dream jobs, secure big salary hikes, and confidently transition into new roles. (pause)

These are just a few of their success stories. (pause)

---Slide 50---

Testimonials. (pause)

---Slide 51---

I want to say this very clearly — I highly encourage you to invest this small amount in yourself. (pause)
And I’m so confident in this system that I’ve removed all the risk for you. (pause)

This comes with a 100% money-back guarantee. (pause)
That means you can attend the very first session completely risk-free. (pause)
If, for any reason, you feel it’s not relevant for you — just let us know, and we’ll refund your full amount. (pause)
No questions asked. (pause)

So really, you have nothing to lose… and everything to gain. (pause)

---Slide 52---

Before we wrap… (pause, look around, smile)
Let me show you something powerful. (pause)

If we map job seekers on two simple axes — mindset and strategy —
we end up with four types. (pause)

👉 Type 1: The Blamer. (pause)
They blame the market… HR… even the economy. (pause)
Sometimes they even hide their own gaps. (pause, shake head slightly)
The result? (pause) No ownership… and no progress. (firm tone)

👉 Type 2: The Staller. (pause)
They think really hard… (pause, hand to head)
But do very little. (pause)
Hours of research… but no real action. (pause, slow firm tone)
A plan on paper… but paralysis in practice. (pause)

👉 Type 3: The Dabbler. (pause)
They try everything — random tips from YouTube, a template from somewhere, advice from a friend. (pause, slight shrug, smile)
Effort is high… but it’s scattered. (pause)
And when effort is scattered… results are random. (pause, nod slowly)

👉 Type 4: The Seeker. (pause)
Now this… (pause, point to top right) is where success lives. (pause)

The Seeker takes ownership… (pause)
Asks for help… (pause)
Follows a plan… (pause)
And executes consistently. (pause, strong uplifting tone)

And that’s (speak louder) exactly what we do inside this program. (pause)

So quick self-check: (pause, eye contact)
Which box are you in today? (pause)
And more importantly… which one do you want to be in next week? (pause)

Because here’s the truth… (pause, lean forward slightly)
Type 4 isn’t luck. (pause)
It’s a decision — plus a system. (firm tone, small hand gesture)

And that’s (speak louder) exactly what the Job Winning Workshop gives you. (pause)

---Slide 53---

I really want to see you on the other side of today’s webinar — inside our upcoming 4-week Job Winning Workshop. (pause)

All 8 sessions are live, with over 12 hours of practical, hands-on training. (pause)

And one more thing — this special offer is only valid for the next one hour. (pause)

The payment link is right there on your screen. (pause)
Take this one smart step for your career — and you’ll be amazed (smile) at the difference it makes. (pause)

---Slide 54---

Before we end, let me leave you with this thought. (pause)

The job you’re dreaming about… (pause)
the salary you want… (pause)
the career growth you deserve… (pause)
It’s all possible. (pause, soft tone)

But it won’t happen by chance. (pause)
It will only happen by choice. (pause, firm tone)

So ask yourself today — (pause, lean forward slightly)
Are you ready to choose action over waiting? (pause)
Are you ready to invest in yourself? (pause)
Are you ready to follow a system that actually works? (pause, smile)
